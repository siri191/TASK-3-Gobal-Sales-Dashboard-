# Global-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

- In this project, I have created an interactive **Power BI Sales Dashboard** using the **Global Superstore** sales dataset to extract meaningful business insights.  
- The **ETL process** was performed using **Power Query** to clean and transform raw data, and **DAX** was used for creating calculated measures and calculated columns for enhanced analytics.  
- Once the data was prepared, I designed a fully interactive dashboard with **cards, charts, slicers, and filters** to provide an intuitive user experience.  
- This helps stakeholders easily understand the information and make informed business decisions.
